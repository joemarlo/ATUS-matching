### Next steps
- Start on clustering


### Outstanding questions / notes
- Do we need full matching? Or just matching for all of 2007 or all of 2009
- Add full time part time status?
- Should we match on labor force? what if people change?
- There is secondary activity spent on childcare and eldercare; need to figure out how to pull

### Current matching results
