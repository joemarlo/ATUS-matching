### At what date were children most likely to be at home?

We can report the proportion of respondents who are working from home by date. 

> Definition for WFH: is there at least one 30 minute period in their day that is "work" and the location is "Respondent's home or yard"

This definition likely overestimates the number of individuals working-from-home. Survey weights applied via resampling. Sample is not restricted to couples.

### Provide context of people taken out of employment? More likely to be women or men? Gender difference in reports of child care by the unemployed?

Need to look at unemployment numbers
